# Deploy-Static-Website-on-AWS

The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. The whole project has two major intentions to implement:

Hosting a static website on S3 and Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service as CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.

# Project working files includes:

index.html - The Index document for the website. 
/img - The background image file for the website. 
/vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function. 
/css - CSS files for the website.

# In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS by performing the following steps:

Created a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket. 
Configured the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies. 
Speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront. 
Then accessed the website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
